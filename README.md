**Recordings**

The `record/` folder has been created in the repository for submission videos and short screen recordings.

- Please add a screen recording (up to 40 seconds) showing the required interactions to the `record/` folder or attach it directly to the issue.
- Preferred formats: MP4 (H.264), keep file size reasonable (<50 MB if possible).

---

Playable demo (recommended)

- Markdown link (opens GitHub file page where Chrome will play the video):

  [Play demo recording (40s)](record/demo.mp4)

- Direct raw URL (opens raw video file — the browser will play it directly):

  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abaddona74-glitch/CollapsibleChatThread/main/record/demo.mp4

Notes

- GitHub README does not reliably render the `<video>` HTML tag inline. The markdown link above is the most reliable way to let reviewers open and play the video in Chrome.
- If you want an inline web player, consider publishing with GitHub Pages and embedding the `<video>` tag there.
